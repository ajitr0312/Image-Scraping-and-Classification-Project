# Image-Scraping-and-Classification-Project
This project is part of my Data Science intern with FlipRobo Technologies.
Images are one of the major sources of data in the field of data science and AI. This field is making appropriate use of information that can be gathered through images by examining its features and details.
The main objective of this project is to build a deep learning model which can classify the images based on the cloth type.
